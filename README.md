# chrome-close-other-tabs

Since Chrome 78 Canary build developers removed ability to Close Other Tabs.  
This extension returns ability to Close Other Tabs except active one and pinned.  
You can close other tabs by clicking directly on extension icon or using shortcut â€” `Alt+Shift+W`.  
Happy closing!
